This is just a couple of notebooks I wrote to play around with NERFs, to better understand how they work. It is based on the [2022 ECCV tutorial](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/nerf-tutorial/home) and the [Tiny NERFs notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bmild/nerf/blob/master/tiny_nerf.ipynb). The first one teaches a NERF to reproduce an image; the second one performs LDDMM registration between two images.
